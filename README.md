# DOM Playground

## Description
This is a simple DOM playground that allows you to manipulate some arbitrary HTML elements using Javascript Drag and Drop API. It allows the user to drag and drop the elements to a specific location on the screen and learn how HTML nesting works by visually seeing the elements being one inside the other. 

You can also customize the element attributes and see the changes in real-time. The playground also has some error handling to prevent the user from nesting elements that are not allowed to be nested or exceeding the maximum number of children allowed for a specific element.

Also, the playground allows you to generate the HTML code of the elements you created and copy it to the clipboard.

You can see the project live [here](https://html-dom-playground.vercel.app/).
