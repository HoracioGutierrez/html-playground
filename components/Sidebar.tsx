      <p className='opacity-60 mb-4'>This playground was created with the intention of having a tool for beginners to better learn HTML nesting and the structure of the DOM. You can drag and drop elements to the DOM and see how they nest.</p>
      <p className='opacity-60 mb-4'>In case you try to nest an element inside another element that doesn&apos;t allow it, the playground will show you an error message. You will also get an error message if you exceed the nesting limit for that particular element.</p>
      <p className="opacity-60 mb-4">You can start by dragging the yellow badges on the right side of the screen and dropping them into the area that says <span className="font-thin italic"> &apos;index.html&apos;</span>.</p>
      <p className="opacity-60 mb-4">Once you have nested at least one element, a button that says <span className="font-thin italic">&apos;generate html&apos;</span> will appear. Clicking on it will generate the HTML code for the elements you have nested and copy it to your clipboard automatically.</p>
      <p className="opacity-60 mb-4">You can also remove elements by clicking on the <span className="font-thin italic">&apos;x&apos;</span> icons that appears on the top right corner of the element you want to remove.</p>
      <p className="opacity-60 mb-12">Also, you can edit the attributes of the elements by clicking on the <span className="font-thin italic">&apos;edit&apos;</span> icons that appears on the top right corner of the element you want to edit. A popup will appear with the attributes of the element, you can edit them and click on the <span className="font-thin italic">&apos;save&apos;</span> button to save the changes.</p>
      <p className="opacity-60 mb-10 text-accent text-center">Enjoy! ðŸš€</p>
